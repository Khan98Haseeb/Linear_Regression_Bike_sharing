# Linear_Regression_Bike_sharing
Predict the number of customers who would use the bike sharing service based on the weather conditions of the day. The data set is imported from the csv file "day.csv" which gives the weather conditions for the days of the year 2018 and 2019 and the total number of customer who used to service on each day. 

I created a Linear regression model which predicts the number of customer the  bike sharing company can expect based on the weather conditions and accordingly take business decisions.
